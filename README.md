# Oasis Drupal commerce projects

Конфигурация для Drupal 8.*

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
git clone git@github.com:oasis-catalog/drupal.git some-dir --no-interaction

composer install
```
